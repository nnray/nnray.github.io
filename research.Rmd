Forthcoming. <a href=Dunaway,_Ray,_Lawrence_and_Napoli_Pre-Print_Copy.pdf> "Communication Technology and Threats to Democracy: We Are (Also) the Problem."</a> In <a href=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/edit/10.4324/9781003257998/news-quality-digital-age-regina-lawrence-philip-napoli> News Quality in the Digital Age</a>, edited by Regina Lawrence and Philip Napoli.

    <p align="justify" style="font-size:16px;margin-left: 50px;"> Abstract: We argue that academic discussions of digital media and its effects need to more heavily consider how individuals process digital information and not just how much or what kinds they are exposed to. Moreover, we highlight that digital media maintains attributes of more traditional media that qualifies its expected political impact.

    <h4 style="margin-left: 10px;"> Ray, Nicholas N. 2022. <a href=https://github.com/nnray/On_Government_Borrowing_Behavior-LaTeX_Code_and_.pdf/blob/main/.pdf/On_Government_Borrowing_Behavior.pdf> "On Government Borrowing Behavior."</a> </h4>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:16px;margin-left: 50px;"> Abstract: In this working paper, I argue that the observed variation in borrowing behavior by recipient countries in Africa can be explained by the dissonant conditionalities associated with Chinese and Western loans. Autocracies, who find it more costly to accept Western loans due to the West's historical emphasis on liberal political reforms, accept Western loans at an inefficiently low rate and forgo potentially lower conditions stemming from Chinese loan competition. I test the hypothesis that African autocracies have higher proportions of Chinese loans to World Bank loans but do not find support for the statistical importance of regime type. GDP per capita, though, seems to be inversely related with the ratio of Chinese loans to World Bank loans.

    <p align="justify" style="font-size:16px;margin-left: 50px;"> Abstract: I argue that the U.S. is funding digital infrastructure in Africa to prevent the Chinese from building such infrastructure and closing market access to U.S. technology firms. Testing the implications that U.S. foreign aid spending is directly related to a measure for internet governance and inversely related to Chinese aid, I find mixed results in a sample of 44 African countries from 2010-2017. U.S. aid seems directly related to both internet governance and Chinese spending.
