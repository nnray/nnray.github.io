  <h1> Social Science </h1>
    <h3> Introduction </h3>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:16px;"> I aim to provide a brief overview of modeling and estimation techniques from my perspective as a political science scholar, which is heavily steeped in the frequentist tradition and my experience with linear models and `R`. This guide is primarily a personal exercise in organizing and solidifying my knowledge on this topic, although it could be useful to other social science students and applied researchers.  </p>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:16px;"> In general, social science involves building empirical models to estimate theoretical quantities of interest. <p>
