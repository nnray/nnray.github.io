  <h1> Biography </h1>
    <p> I am a political science PhD student at Texas A&M University-College Station studying political economy. I primarily seek to understand how shifts in the geopolitical landscape and great power competition affect global finance outcomes (e.g., foreign aid) for developing countries. In addition, I am interested in illuminating the political consequences of increasingly sophisticated information and communication technologies (ICTs).
