  <p align="justify" style="font-size:20px;"> I like to read and build my small library. I enjoy mostly non-fiction, including philosophy and books about both the social and natural sciences. My favorite book is Plutarch's <a href=https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/plutarch/lives/home.html><u>Lives of the Noble Greeks and Romans</u></a>- or simply, Plutarch's <u>Lives</u>.

  <p align="justify" style="font-size:20px;"> I also enjoy running. One of my favorite things to do is to trail run in a state park or at the nearby Lake Bryan.
