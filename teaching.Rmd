  <p align="justify" style="font-size:16px;margin-left: 50px;"> In Spring 2024 I was the teaching assistant for MLE. The class is part of the methods sequence for first-year PhD students in political science at A&M. I led a weekly discussion section and graded assignments. Course evaluations are not yet available.</p>

  <p align="justify" style="font-size:16px;margin-left: 50px;"> In Fall 2023 I was the teaching assistant for OLS. The class is also part of the methods sequence for first-year PhD students. I led weekly discussion sections and both created and graded assignments. Some examples of the assignments I created for students and the material I covered in discussion sections can be found above along with the course evaluation. Questions 8-10 pertain to the teaching assistant. </p>

  <p align="justify" style="font-size:16px;margin-left: 50px;"> In Spring 2023 I was a teaching assistant for this undergraduate class introducing students to political science research methods. The course focuses on familiarizing students with the fundamentals of conducting social science research, such as building causal theories and utilizing common statistical software (`R`) to evaluate hypotheses with observational data. I graded assignments and held weekly recitations where I elaborated on topics discussed during lectures and demonstrated the use of `R`. I taught two sections with a combined 50 students. Course evaluations can be found above, with questions 8-10 related to my teaching. </p>

The class exposes students to historically important substantive work in the field and briefly discusses basic quantitative research methods and ideas, such as linear regression and experiments. In Fall 2021 and Spring 2022 I taught about 20 students whereas in Fall 2022 I taught 42. I led weekly discussion sections and graded assignments. The course evaluations can be found above with question items 8-10 most pertain to the teaching assistant. </p>
