    <p align="justify" style="font-size:16px;"> Click <a href=https://catalog.tamu.edu/undergraduate/course-descriptions/pols/>here </a> to see Texas A&M University's course descriptions for political science (POLS). </p>
    <h3> POLS 602 </h3>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:16px;"> 602 is the introductory empirical modeling course for first-year PhD students. I lead weekly recitation sessions as well as create and grade homeworks. </p>

I held weekly recitation sessions where I elaborated on topics discussed during lectures and demonstrated the use of `R`. </p>
    <h4 style="margin-left: 10px;"> Spring 2023 </h4>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:16px;margin-left: 50px;"> I taught two sections with a combined 50 students. The course evaluations will be published here soon, along with examples of my teaching materials.

    <h3> POLS 200 </h3>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:16px;"> This class, titled the "Foundations of Political Science," is the introductory course in political science at A&M. It mainly focuses on historically important topics to the field, such as political violence and elections, without specifying common subfields like international relations (IR) or American politics (AP). There is also brief exposure to basic quantitative research methods and ideas, such as linear regression and experimental settings.
    </p>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:16px;"> It is intended to be a writing-intensive class, with students completing 5 two-page essays throughout the semester that are graded by the teaching assistant. There are also three to four multiple-choice exams throughout the course that are typically conducted online and graded with software.
    </p>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:16px;"> Students attend plenary lectures with the instructor of record on Monday's and Wednesday's. Recitations, known as discussion sessions, are held on Friday's and are taught by the teaching assistant associated with a student's section.
